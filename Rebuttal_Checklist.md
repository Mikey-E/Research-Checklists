# Rebuttal Checklist

- Most reviews contain some misunderstanding and this is *your* fault as the paper writer.
- Gather reviews into one shared document.
- Add newlines after every comment, positive or negative.
- Consider if the reviwer mistyped anything.
- Sort concerns by importance (if known).
- Answer unambiguously and short.
- It may be worth having a "general" section at the top that addresses any issues that apply to multiple reviewers.
    - Having a general section may be to your disadvantage, because you don't want to be pointing out *more* potential problems in your paper to reviewers, problems that they might've not focused on. Grouping questions by reviewer makes them much more likely to only read their own section.
- If you were wrong, own it. Just try to do it in a way that still makes you look good.
- Thank them for their constructive feedback.
- The reviewer most likely listed strengths of your paper, re-emphasize those in your rebuttal so you're reminding the reviewer of the positives.
- Order matters - start your answers with the biggest concerns you have good answers for.
- Being conversational will help the reviewer feel like the rebuttal is less combative.
- Respond to the *intent* of the questions.
- Sleep on it before sending (if possible).
- Back up your claims with numbers when possible (more convincing than just an argument).
- If a reviewer has a problem with something you referenced, try to reach out to the reference authors to ask about it. That way you can say you
contacted them and what *their* response was.
