# Rebuttal Checklist

- Most reviews contain some misunderstanding and this is *your* fault as the paper writer.

- Gather reviews into one shared document.
- Add newlines after every comment, positive or negative.
- Consider if the reviwer mistyped anything.
- Sort concerns by importance (if known).
- Answer unambiguously and short.
- It may be worth having a "general" section at the top that addresses any issues that apply to multiple reviewers.
- If you were wrong, own it. Just try to do it in a way that still makes you look good.
- Thank them for their constructive feedback.
